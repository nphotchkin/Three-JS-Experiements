# Three-JS-Experiments
Just playing around with three.js from the documentation

N.B. given that these are experiments to understand WebGL theres little to no consideration for code quality, anything goes break every rule until you can't progress then move to another project and tidy it up.

`npm install`

`npm run start` (server starts on localhost:4200)
